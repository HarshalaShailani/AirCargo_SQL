# AirCargo_SQL
## Description
Air Cargo is an aviation company that provides air transportation services for passengers and freight. Air Cargo uses its aircraft to provide different services with the help of partnerships or alliances with other airlines. The company wants to prepare reports on regular passengers, busiest routes, ticket sales details, and other scenarios to improve the ease of travel and booking for customers.
### Project Objective:
You, as a DBA expert, need to focus on identifying the regular customers to provide offers, analyze the busiest route which helps to increase the number of aircraft required and prepare an analysis to determine the ticket sales details. This will ensure that the company improves its operability and becomes more customer-centric and a favorable choice for air travel.
### Following operations should be performed:
1. Create an ER diagram for the given airlines database.![image](https://github.com/HarshalaShailani/AirCargo_SQL/assets/141167769/14e8afbc-e0c0-4b36-8261-36f7e8d7a030)
2. Write a query to create route_details table using suitable data types for the fields, such as route_id, flight_num, origin_airport, destination_airport, aircraft_id, and distance_miles. Implement the check constraint for the flight number and unique constraint for the route_id fields. Also, make sure that the distance miles field is greater than 0. ![image](https://github.com/HarshalaShailani/AirCargo_SQL/assets/141167769/2874690a-ebb0-4063-bb68-21f01d7c7abc)
